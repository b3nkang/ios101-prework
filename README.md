## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

#### Favorite applications: 
- Beli (food rating app)
    - How restaurants are rated relative to each other, so the rating generated is organic
    - How one can see friends' ratings
    - How there are numerous ways to filter one's rated spots, whether by cuisine, proximity, or rating
- Strava
    - How one's activity history is very easy to find with relevant statistics alongside each activity
    - How Strava allows for various types of achievements, such as personal bests on segments, longest duration, and segment leaderboards to measure self-improvement
    - How easy it is to add others to activities and post group exercises
- Discord
    - How many possibilities there are for types of servers to provide a space for sharing knowledge
    - How, despite the ability for servers to grow expansively with many channels, the UI is fairly intuitive, organized, and navigable
    - How there are multiple modes of communication and types of way to communicate within the same server: stages, voice chats, threads, and more
    
#### App Idea:

One of the great problems of the internet lies in our photos: where to find them. As a child of the "gen-z" era, I generally wish to track down a photo with as little energy as possible, yet, in the age of saved TikToks, meme screenshots, and other forms of camera-roll clutter, it can often prove a challenge; current organization features—filtering, albums, etc—are woefully insufficient. So, what if we created an app, built for screenshots and clutter, that automatically and intelligently cataloged one's images? We could use both photo metadata and computer vision to detect social media platforms (e.g. Reddit and TikTok are quite recognizable), allowing for curated albums that reduce clutter between memories and mere screenshots. The app would first have to be a lower-level clone of any standard photos app, but with additional functionality built on top, allowing for an intelligent "screenshot sorter".
